This level editor is called WebJCS, because the original editor is called Jazz Creation Station (JCS). WebJCS is an open-source improved clone of JCS, running in your web browser (only Google Chrome is supported at the moment). JCS is included with the game Jazz Jackrabbit 2 that was released in 1998 by Epic MegaGames (or Epic Games as it’s known today).

I started this project in 2007-2008, using simple <img>s, <div>s, PHP and JS code. Today with <canvas>, rendering is a breeze, and JavaScript engines have become a whole lot faster.

This improved clone is, without any reused code, fully compatible with the game. To run the levels you create, you need the game, as I have not yet made a HTML5 version of it.

WebJCS requires to be hosted from a server, as browser JavaScript don’t have access to the local filesystem or native modules such as Zlib.
The code behind WebJCS is written entirely by me, except FileSaver.js, Node.JS and some node modules.

You can try it out live on my hosted collaborative server here: http://djazz.mine.nu:8010/

How do I install WebJCS?
Firstly, install Google Chrome. It’s the only browser good enough for handling demanding graphics and it’s very fast. If other browsers catch up, I might add support for them to.
Windows:
Unzip it in any folder, not necessarily in your Jazz2 folder.
Download Node.JS (if not included in the zip) HERE and put it inside the folder you unzipped to.
Edit the file settings.ini to match your configuration, such as path to Jazz2 folder for finding level/tilesets, command to run when you want to Run your level and the path to your Google Chrome install.
Then make a shortcut to the WebJCS.bat file, as you would do with any program/file you want a shortcut to.
Linux:
Unzip it in any folder.
First you must compile node.js.
Edit the file settings.ini to match your configuration, such as path to a folder for finding level/tilesets, command to run when you want to Run your level and the path to your Google Chrome install.
When entering a path to JJ2, it have to be an absolute path. The default JJ2 path for wine is:
/home/username/.wine/drive_c/Games/Jazz2/
The command for Chrome is google-chrome.
Create a launcher with the command “node path-to-server.js”, choose “open in terminal”
